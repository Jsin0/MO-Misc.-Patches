This mod contains a collection of patches that try to harmonize a variety of mods with Medieval Overhaul. This is my first mod and I haven't playtested much so any feedback or suggestion is appreciated.

For people who use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2586052937]SeedsPlease:Lite[/url], you can use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2633276599]Cherry Picker[/url] to remove the MO wheat, sugar, and herb for the seed extraction recipe to work with the VCE changes.

Compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2730497766]Medieval Overhaul Tweaks[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670516806]Medieval Cross-Functionality Patches+[/url] probably. I use both and haven't noticed an issue.
